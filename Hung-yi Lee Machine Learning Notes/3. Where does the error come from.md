## 3. Where does the error come from? 

Question: A more complex model does not always lead to better performance on testing data?

Answer: Bias and Variance(偏差和方差)

### 总结：

* There is usually a trade-off between bias and variance

* Select a model that balances two kinds of error to minimize total error

* N-fold Cross Validation 交叉验证，取最低平均错误率的模型
